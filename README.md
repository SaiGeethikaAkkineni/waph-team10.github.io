# System Analysis

_(Start from Sprint 0, keep updating)_

## High-level Requirements

List high-level requirements of the project that your team will develop into use cases in later steps

# System Design

_(Start from Sprint 1, keep updating)_

## Use-Case Realization

## Database 

## User Interface

# Implementation

_(Start from Sprint 1, keep updating. However, it is important to prepare the technology from Sprint 0)_

For each new sprint cycle, update the implementation of your system (break it down into subsections). Please include some code snippets to illustrate the implementation.

Specify your team's development approach, including programming languages, databases, development, testing, and deployment environments. 

# Security analysis

_Include a brief explanation of your implementation and the security aspects based on the following questions:_

*  How did you apply the security programming principles in your project?
*  What database security principles have you used in your project?
*  Is your code robust and defensive? How?
*  How did you defend your code against known attacks such as XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, Session Hijacking
*   How do you separate the roles of super users and regular users?

# Demo (screenshots)

_You need to capture screenshots to demonstrate how your web application works. The screenshots must be accompanied by a short description of its functionalities following the implementation as below:_

*   Everyone can register a new account and then login
*   Superuser can disable an account
    *   The disabled account cannot log in 
    *   Superuser can enable the disabled account
    *   The enabled user can log in	
*   A regular logged-in user can delete her own existing posts but cannot delete the posts of others
*   CSRF attack to delete a post should be detected and prevented
*   A regular logged-in user cannot access the link for superusers
*   A logged-in user can have a real-time chat with other logged-in users

# Software Process Management
